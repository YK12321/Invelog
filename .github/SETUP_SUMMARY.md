# GitHub Workflows Setup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the GitHub Actions workflows that have been set up for the Invelog project.

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`
**Purpose:** Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for testing builds across multiple platforms.

**Key Features:**
- Automatically triggers on push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Automatically triggers on pull requests targeting `main` or `develop`
- Tests build on three platforms: Ubuntu (Linux), Windows, and macOS
- Uses CMake for cross-platform build configuration
- Uploads build artifacts for inspection
- Runs in parallel across all platforms (fail-fast disabled)

**Build Process:**
1. Checkout code
2. Install CMake
3. Configure CMake with Release build type
4. Build the project
5. Upload artifacts (executables)

### 2. `.github/workflows/release.yml`
**Purpose:** Manual workflow for creating official releases with source code and platform-specific executables.

**Key Features:**
- Manual trigger only (workflow_dispatch)
- Requires version input (e.g., v1.0.0)
- Creates GitHub release with version tag
- Builds executables for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Packages source code as zip
- Packages each platform's executables separately

**Release Process:**
1. **Create Release Job:**
   - Creates source code zip archive
   - Creates GitHub release with specified version tag
   - Uploads source archive to release

2. **Build Release Job (runs for each platform):**
   - Builds executables for the platform
   - Packages binaries with documentation:
     - Linux: `.tar.gz` format
     - macOS: `.tar.gz` format
     - Windows: `.zip` format
   - Uploads packaged binaries to release

**Release Assets:**
- `invelog-vX.X.X-source.zip` - Source code
- `invelog-vX.X.X-linux-x64.tar.gz` - Linux executables
- `invelog-vX.X.X-macos-x64.tar.gz` - macOS executables
- `invelog-vX.X.X-windows-x64.zip` - Windows executables

### 3. `.github/WORKFLOWS.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation for using the workflows.

**Contents:**
- Detailed explanation of each workflow
- Step-by-step instructions for creating releases
- Troubleshooting guide
- Version numbering guidelines (SemVer)
- Notes about requirements and limitations

### 4. Updated `.gitignore`
**Change:** Added `package/` directory to ignore list.

**Reason:** The release workflow creates a temporary `package/` directory when building release assets. This ensures it doesn't get accidentally committed.

## How to Use

### Running Build Tests
Build tests run automatically when you:
- Push commits to `main` or `develop` branches
- Create pull requests targeting `main` or `develop`

No manual action required!

### Creating a Release
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. Select **Release** from the workflows list
4. Click **Run workflow**
5. Enter version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
6. Click **Run workflow** button

The workflow will:
- Create the release
- Build executables for all platforms
- Upload all assets to the release

## Technical Details

### Build Configuration
- **CMake Version:** Latest (installed via lukka/get-cmake)
- **Build Type:** Release
- **C++ Standard:** C++17 (as defined in CMakeLists.txt)
- **Platforms:** 
  - Ubuntu (latest)
  - Windows (latest)
  - macOS (latest)

### Dependencies
- Dependencies are automatically fetched via CMake FetchContent:
  - nlohmann/json
  - cpp-httplib
  - SQLite3 (if system version not found)

### Executables Built
Each release includes two executables per platform:
1. `invelog` / `invelog.exe` - Main demo application
2. `invelog_server` / `invelog_server.exe` - Database API server

### Known Limitations
- The workflows use deprecated GitHub actions for release creation (`actions/create-release@v1` and `actions/upload-release-asset@v1`)
  - These still work but may be replaced in future updates
  - Alternative: `softprops/action-gh-release` (more modern)
- Build artifacts in CI workflow are kept for 90 days (GitHub default)
- If the project has existing build errors, the workflows will fail
  - This is expected behavior - workflows test that builds succeed

## Verification

Both workflow files have been validated:
- ✅ YAML syntax is valid
- ✅ No critical linting errors
- ✅ All required fields are present
- ✅ Proper job dependencies configured

To test the workflows:
1. **Build Test:** Push a commit or create a PR to trigger it
2. **Release:** Use the manual trigger process described above

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add automated testing steps (unit tests, integration tests)
- Add code coverage reporting
- Migrate to modern release actions
- Add checksum generation for release assets
- Add automated release notes generation
- Add build caching to speed up builds
- Add conditional workflows (e.g., skip builds if only docs changed)
- Add security scanning (CodeQL, dependency scanning)

## Maintenance Notes

- Workflows are version controlled in `.github/workflows/`
- Changes to workflows take effect immediately after merge to main branch
- Old workflow runs are kept in GitHub Actions history
- Workflow logs are useful for debugging build issues
- GitHub provides free Actions minutes for public repositories

## Support

For issues with workflows:
1. Check workflow logs in the Actions tab
2. Refer to `.github/WORKFLOWS.md` for detailed documentation
3. Review GitHub Actions documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions

For build-specific issues:
1. Try building locally with CMake
2. Check CMakeLists.txt configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly configured
4. Review build logs for specific error messages
