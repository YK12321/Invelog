# Invelog

> A comprehensive inventory management system for electronic components with advanced tracking, multi-location support, and project management capabilities.

## Overview

Invelog is a robust inventory management solution designed to track electronic components across multiple locations, containers, and projects. Built with scalability and flexibility in mind, it provides real-time tracking of components with unique identification and comprehensive activity logging.

## Key Features

### üèóÔ∏è Hierarchical Organization
- **Multi-Location Support**: Manage inventory across multiple physical locations
- **Container Management**: Organize items in containers and subcontainers
- **Category System**: Classify components by categories for easy organization
- **UUID Tracking**: Every subcontainer and item is assigned a unique identifier for precise tracking

### üì¶ Inventory Management
- **Main Storage Containers**: Designated inventory containers for primary storage
- **Project-Specific Containers**: Create dedicated containers for individual projects
- **Item Movement**: Seamlessly transfer items between main inventory and project containers
- **Component Tracking**: Monitor individual components regardless of their current location

### üìä Activity Logging
- **Usage Tracking**: Log all activity for each item in the system
- **Check-In/Check-Out**: Track when items are checked out and checked in
- **Time Monitoring**: Record the duration items spend in different containers or projects
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete history of component movements and usage

### üóÇÔ∏è Project Management
- **Project Creation**: Set up projects with dedicated container allocation
- **Resource Allocation**: Move components from main inventory to project-specific containers
- **Project Tracking**: Monitor component usage per project over time

### üíæ Data Storage
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Built using OOP principles for efficient data management
- **Local Database Support**: Store data locally for offline access
- **SQL Database Integration**: Connect to SQL-based databases for enterprise-scale deployments
- **Flexible Architecture**: Read and write capabilities across multiple database backends

## Architecture

Invelog leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) to provide a clean, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns. The system architecture supports:

- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Database Abstraction**: Switch between local and SQL databases seamlessly
- **Scalability**: Handles small workshops to large enterprise inventories

## Use Cases

- **Electronics Workshops**: Track components across multiple storage locations
- **Makerspaces**: Manage shared inventory and project-specific allocations
- **R&D Labs**: Monitor component usage across research projects
- **Manufacturing**: Track parts from warehouse to production floor
- **Educational Institutions**: Manage lab equipment and student project materials
